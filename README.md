# ChwTodoApp

This project was created as part of a design interview task for an unbranded company. The objective of the project was to build a simple Todo List application.

# Project Overview
Back-End: Node.js
Front-End: Angular
Front-End Libraries: Bootstrap, jQuery
The project consists of a Back-End component built using Node.js and a Front-End component created using the Angular framework. The primary functionality of the application is to manage a list of tasks (Todo List) where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Additionally, Bootstrap and jQuery libraries have been integrated into the project to enhance the user interface and user experience

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Note
The code created for this project was influenced by and used references from a number of sources. External resources were utilized to help with the development process because of time restrictions and the necessity to learn quickly. In order to speed up development and improve the user interface, Bootstrap and jQuery technologies were also used.

Despite this, the project successfully fulfills the requirements of the design interview task and showcases the ability to learn and implement new technologies within a tight deadline.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with the application, and further enhance its features based on your learning and experiences.
